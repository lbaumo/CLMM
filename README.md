# CLMM

A new and improved cluster mass modeling code descended from [clmassmod](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/clmassmod)

## Motivation

`clmm` is a general code for performing individual- and population-level inference on galaxy cluster weak lensing data.  It will serve to enable the CLMassMod Key Task of [the LSST-DESC SRM](http://lsst-desc.org/sites/default/files/DESC_SRM_V1_1.pdf) and will be used as a framework for future CL WG activities.

## Notes to the developers from the developers

* Classes should have easy functions that print their own documentation, especially with respect to keyword arguments for wrapped code.  --@lbaumo
